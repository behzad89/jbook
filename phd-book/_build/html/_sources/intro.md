# **Spatio-temporal modelling of exposure to airborne pollen**


It aims to model the day-to-day and geographic variations of pollen in different climatic regions of Switzerland. I will use these models to estimate peopleâ€™s exposure to airborne pollen for subsequent epidemiological research into a diversity of health effects. During the modelling process, I am working work with measured pollen concentrations, weather data, geographic datasets and satellite observations to improve pollen exposure mapping.
