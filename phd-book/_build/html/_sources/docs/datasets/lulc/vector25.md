# Vector 25

The swissTLM did not include all the natural areas as a class, therefore the supplemented data with agricultural areas were extracted from the older Vector25. Both datasets were from SwissTopo [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412017308024#s0010):

Folowwing layers were extracted to merge with swissTML:

* Z_BaumS (Baumschule)- Plantation tree
* Z_GsPist (Graspiste)- Grass
* Z_ObstAn (Obstangle)- Fruit plantation
* Z_Reben (Reben)- Wine
* Z_Uebrig (Ubriiges Gebiet)- Others
